//! Transaction management for the database engine.
//!
//! This module provides the core building blocks for ACID-style transactions:
//! a [`TransactionManager`] that hands out [`Transaction`] handles, and a
//! [`CompletedTransaction`] record that captures the outcome after commit or
//! abort.
//!
//! Each transaction is assigned a unique, monotonically increasing
//! [`TransactionId`] and is recorded in the write-ahead log (WAL) so that
//! incomplete transactions can be recovered or rolled back after a crash.
//! Page locks acquired during the transaction are released automatically when
//! the transaction finishes.
//!
//! # Lifecycle
//!
//! ```text
//! TransactionManager::begin()
//!     → Transaction (state: Active)
//!         → Transaction::commit() → CompletedTransaction (state: Committed)
//!         → Transaction::abort()  → CompletedTransaction (state: Aborted)
//!         → drop() while Active   → implicit abort
//! ```
