# StoreMy

> A fully-featured relational database management system built from scratch in Go

StoreMy is a production-grade educational database engine implementing core DBMS concepts including ACID transactions, query optimization, crash recovery, and concurrent access control. Built entirely from the ground up without external database libraries, it demonstrates sophisticated systems programming and deep understanding of database internals.

**Want to test StoreMy in 2 minutes?** Just run:

```bash
make quickstart
```

Or using Docker Compose directly:

```bash
docker-compose up storemy-demo
```

This starts the database with pre-loaded demo data. Press **Ctrl+E** to execute queries, **Ctrl+H** for help.

### Concurrency Control Architecture

- **Page-Level Locking**: Shared locks for reads, exclusive locks for writes
- **Lock Upgrade Protocol**: Automatic promotion from shared to exclusive when needed
- **Deadlock Detection**: Maintains wait-for graph with cycle detection
- **Lock Manager**: Coordinates lock acquisition, waiting queues, and grant decisions
- **Transaction Isolation**: Serializable isolation via strict two-phase locking

### Recovery Architecture

- **Write-Ahead Logging Protocol**: Log record forced to disk before page modification
- **Force-at-Commit**: COMMIT record synced before transaction acknowledgment
- **LSN Chaining**: Each log record links to previous for efficient traversal
- **Undo on Abort**: Restores before-images for all dirty pages
- **Log Record Types**: BEGIN, COMMIT, ABORT, INSERT, DELETE, UPDATE

## Technical Highlights

### Buffer Pool Management

The PageStore implements sophisticated buffer management:
- **Maximum Capacity**: 1000 pages (configurable)
- **LRU Eviction**: Least Recently Used policy for clean pages
- **NO-STEAL Policy**: Dirty pages never evicted before commit
- **FORCE Policy**: All dirty pages flushed at commit time
- **Lock Integration**: Coordinates with LockManager for page-level 2PL

### Join Optimization

Cost-based optimizer selects optimal join algorithm:

| Algorithm | Best For | Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
|-----------|----------|-----------------|------------------|
| **Block Nested Loop** | Non-equality predicates, small relations | O(\|R\| + (\|R\|/B) Ã— \|S\|) | O(B) |
| **Hash Join** | Equality predicates, sufficient memory | O(\|R\| + \|S\|) avg | O(\|S\|) |
| **Sort-Merge** | Pre-sorted inputs, large relations | O(\|R\| log \|R\| + \|S\| log \|S\|) | O(1) merge |

Selection criteria based on:
- Predicate type (equality vs. range)
- Table cardinality from catalog statistics
- Available memory for hash tables
- Presence of indexes

### Index Structures

**B+Tree Implementation**:
- Internal nodes store separator keys and child pointers
- Leaf nodes contain (key, RID) pairs with sibling pointers for range scans
- Automatic split/merge operations maintain balance
- O(log n) point queries, O(log n + k) range queries

**Hash Index Implementation**:
- Fixed bucket count determined at creation
- FNV-1a hash function for key distribution
- Separate chaining with overflow pages
- O(1) average case lookups
- Cycle detection prevents infinite overflow chains

## Testing

The project includes comprehensive test coverage across all components:

```bash
# Run all tests
go test ./...

# Run tests with coverage report
go test -cover ./...

# Run tests for specific package
go test ./pkg/storage/heap/...
go test ./pkg/concurrency/lock/...
go test ./pkg/execution/join/...

# Run with verbose output
go test -v ./pkg/database/...
```

### Test Coverage

- **74 test files** covering critical components
- **Unit Tests**: Individual component functionality
- **Integration Tests**: Multi-component interactions
- **Concurrency Tests**: Race condition detection and deadlock scenarios
- **End-to-End Tests**: Full query execution pipelines

## Performance Characteristics

### Storage Layer
- **Page Size**: 4KB (standard database page size)
- **Buffer Pool**: 1000 pages = 4MB default cache
- **Index Lookup**: O(log n) for B+Tree, O(1) average for Hash

### Concurrency
- **Lock Granularity**: Page-level (fine-grained)
- **Deadlock Detection**: Immediate with automatic retry
- **Max Retry Attempts**: 100 with exponential backoff (1ms â†’ 50ms)

### Query Execution
- **Iterator Model**: Memory-efficient tuple-at-a-time processing
- **Join Block Size**: 100 tuples (configurable)
- **Hash Table**: O(1) build and probe for equi-joins

## Project Statistics

- **149 source files** implementing complete DBMS functionality
- **74 test files** with comprehensive coverage
- **~20,000+ lines** of production-quality Go code
- **10+ subsystems** working in concert for database operations

## Design Philosophy

StoreMy demonstrates several key principles:

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Clear boundaries between storage, execution, and concurrency layers
2. **Iterator Pattern**: Unified interface for all query operators enabling composition
3. **Strategy Pattern**: Pluggable join algorithms selected by cost-based optimizer
4. **ACID Compliance**: Proper transaction semantics with 2PL and WAL
5. **Production Patterns**: Professional error handling, logging, and resource management

## Limitations & Future Enhancements

### Current Limitations
- Full crash recovery (redo phase) not yet implemented
- No multi-column indexes or composite keys
- Limited query optimizer (no join reordering)
- Single isolation level (serializable via strict 2PL)
- No support for subqueries, views, or stored procedures

### Potential Enhancements
- [ ] MVCC (Multi-Version Concurrency Control) for higher concurrency
- [ ] Query optimizer improvements (join reordering, cost models)
- [ ] Additional aggregate functions (MEDIAN, STDDEV)
- [ ] Full ARIES recovery protocol implementation
- [ ] Network protocol for client-server architecture
- [ ] Composite indexes and covering indexes
- [ ] Query result caching
- [ ] Parallel query execution
- [ ] Compression for pages and log records
